He... died trying to stop you.

I went there, and there was only dust.

*Sins flow in your blood.

P:

At first, I didn't care for their lives.

But... you taught me the meaning of their existence.

*The smell of smoke dissipates a little.

P:

You don't know their pain...

Human! You will pay for shredding his smile!

*The smoke is gone.

P:

I didn't want to fight you...

But for him, I must.

*Sins flow out.

P:

The monsters behind me(?) see me as a hero, and I do not want to see another speck of dust.

So I must fight you.

*Moonlight shines.

P:

I wonder... what kind of thought leads you to this?

Our desperation became what you called "salvation".

Funny.

*Smells like revenge(or rebellion).

P:

You are determined, eh?

But I am strong too!

*You stop coughing.

P:

If you wish to continue...

Don't blame me for going hard.

*Rain falls outside.

P:

Enough.

Now die!

*Time to end it.

P:

cough I think... this is it, huh?

Nyeh... heh... heh...

...

Sorry, Sans.

Look at the sky.

What a beautiful night...
